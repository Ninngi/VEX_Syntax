Version 1.2.0
==================================================================================================
    Houdini version 14 supported.

    Changes:
        Contexts:
            1) Renamed cop to cop2 (still 11 total as before).

        Keywords:
            2) Added illuminance (was incorrectly listed as a function).

        Types:
            1) Added matrix2 for houdini 14 (vector2 was already in the definition).

        Functions:
            1) Removed gather/illuminance as they are technically special control structures.
            2) Updated definitions for Houdini 14 (600+ function names now).

        Completions:
            1) Basic completions for all functions with positional parameter types hinted.
            2) The python script which queries vcc to generate this data is included.

        Snippets:
            1) Cleanup on pcopen snippets.

        Development:
            1) Definitions are now developed in yaml instead of JSON. Still using AAA package dev.
            2) Project reorganized. Python files moved to 'src' directory.
            3) Python utility for querying vcc and generating completions for all functions and
               overloads.

    Todo:
        1) Special treatment of global variables?
        2) Context in function hints and possibly completions without arguments first.
        3) Fix 'void' completions.
        4) Vex wrangle syntax definition.
        5) Snippets for context skeletons.
